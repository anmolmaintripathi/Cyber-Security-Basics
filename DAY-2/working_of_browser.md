# What is a web browser?
- A web browser is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the screen.

### How does a web browser work ?
-  A web browser takes you anywhere on the internet. It retrieves information from other parts of the web and displays it on your desktop or mobile device. The information is transferred using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which defines how text, images and video are transmitted on the web. This information needs to be shared and displayed in a consistent format so that people using any browser, anywhere in the world can see the information.

- When the web browser fetches data from an internet connected server and it then uses a piece of software called a rendering engine to translate that data into text and images. This data is written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and web browsers read this code to create what we see, hear and experience on the internet. 

- [Hyperlinks](https://github.com/anmolmanitripathi/Cyber-Security-Basics/blob/master/DAY-2/working_of_browser.md#what-are-hyperlinks-) allow users to follow a path to other pages or sites on the web. Every webpage, image and video has its own unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which is also known as a web address. When a browser visits a server for data, the web address tells the browser where to look for each item that is described in the html, which then tells the browser where it goes on the web page. 

##### What are HYPERLINKS : 
  Hyperlinks connect webpages or data items to one another. In HTML, <a> elements define hyperlinks from a spot on a webpage (like a text string or image) to another spot on some other webpage (or even on the same page).
